# Project Name
>  To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Basic CNN models are build, to detect melanoma and other skin dieeases.
- CNN models to detect melanoma, other skin dieseases with multiple models to arrive at most accurate model.
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- Dataset used for this model building is attached in the repo.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The training accuracy looks approximately equal to 93%.
- The validation accuracy looks approximately equal to 83%.
- The model accuracy is overall improved and overfitting has greatly reduced with help of Class Imbalancing.
- Further this model can be improved with adding more layers and increasing number of epochs.
